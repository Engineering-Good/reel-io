reel.io - Smart pulley system for physiotherapy

Physiotherapy pulley systems help our elderly clients rehabilitate and, or, improve their range of motion and strength in their shoulders and arms. The exercise has many benefits for their clients: it helps to improve vital capacity, prevent shoulder stiffness, improve cardiac endurance for post-Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients.
However, existing pulley systems are manual, which makes it difficult to track our clients' progresses. This is made even more challenging for elderly clients who have to a lower impact plan and progress in a more controlled manner. Every small step in the right direction counts and we want to be able to celebrate this with our clients.

The ideal smart shoulder pulley system (bicycle type) should have the following features:
- Power-operated
- Adjustable range and resistance
- Digital timer or counter
- Sensors for vital signs and ECG
The user should be able to view the range, resistance, timer and counter. The real-time visual feedback helps to motivate and educate the client. A stretch goal to consider: the clients' workouts can be tracked in an app for AWWA to monitor progress and collect data to plan future sessions.
